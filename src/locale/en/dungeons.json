First key is earned with defating the boss, second key is earned if darkness is less than 70%, third key is earned if all rooms are completed. When you LEFT click a chest you will get it if you have a key. If you RIGHT click while holding the chest, you will gain a random item. There are 6 types of prize chests: melee & ranged weapons, heavy & light armor, jewelry and pet."
